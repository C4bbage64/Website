                <h3>Configuring Services on Fedora 37 Server</h3>
                <p>
                    For this project, I configured three essential services on a Fedora 37 server: FTPS, SMB file sharing, and an email service. 
                    Setting up FTPS allowed secure file transfers over the FTP protocol, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. 
                    Additionally, implementing SMB file sharing facilitated seamless file sharing and collaboration across a network of devices, 
                    enhancing productivity and efficiency in a business environment. Finally, configuring the email service enabled 
                    reliable communication via email, supporting essential business operations and interactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project involved understanding the intricacies of each service, configuring them to meet specific requirements, 
                    and ensuring proper functionality and security. Through this hands-on experience, I gained valuable insights into 
                    server administration, network protocols, and service management, furthering my expertise in DevOps and cloud computing.
